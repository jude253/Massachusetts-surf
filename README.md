# Massachusetts-surf ARCHIVE

THIS IS AN ARCHIVED VERSION OF README.MD AND THIS BRANCH HAS NO BACKEND.  IT IS THE VERSION FROM 2017.

This website is going to display all the information I need to figure out where &amp; when to surf (around Massachusetts) without clicking

I need some help formatting some bar graphs with chart.js.  I am not familiar with how it works I would like to make the graphs-- done

resizable and have better demensions.-- done

Also I want to split up the "helper.js" file into smaller files so that each file only has one purpose like user interaction or surf charts or bar graphs.-- partially done

I'm going to add in swell direction

Potentially add in tides if I can find a nice place for them.
